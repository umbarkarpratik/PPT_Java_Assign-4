    <p>Q7.Can you pass lambda expressions to a method? When?</p>
    <br>
    <p>Q7 -ANSWER Yes, you can pass lambda expressions as arguments to methods in Java when
         the method parameter type is a functional interface (an interface with a single 
         abstract method). This allows for providing custom behavior directly 
        at the call site without the need for explicit implementations or additional classes.</p>

        <br>
        <br>
        <p>Q8.What is the functional interface in Java 8?</p>
        <br>
        <p>Ans- In Java 8, a functional interface is an interface that contains exactly one
             abstract method. It is used in conjunction with lambda expressions and method
              references for functional programming. Functional interfaces enable the use 
              of lambda expressions and provide a clear
             contract for implementing a single behavior or functionality.</p>

        <br>
        <br>
        <p>Q9.What is the benefit of lambda expressions in Java 8?</p>
        <br>
        <p>Answer-Lambda expressions in Java 8 provide a concise syntax, promote functional 
            programming, improve code reusability, enhance API design, simplify parallel and 
            asynchronous programming, 
            enable readable stream operations, and make event handling code more expressive.</p>

            <br>
            <br>
            <p>Q10.Is it mandatory for a lambda expression to have parameters?</p>
            <br>
            <p>No, it is not mandatory for a lambda expression to have parameters. The presence
                 or absence of parameters in a lambda expression depends on the functional
                  interface that it is implementing.</p>
